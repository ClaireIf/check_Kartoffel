# check Kartoffel - Check Kartoffel prices in German supermarkets.

This project automates the process of checking the prices of potatoes (Kartoffeln) in popular German supermarkets like Aldi, Lidl, Kaufland, Netto and others using Python and Playwright.

## Description
This is just a small test.
This Python script leverages Playwright to automate the task of retrieving the price of potatoes from various German supermarkets, including **Aldi**,**Lidl**, **Kaufland** and **Netto**. The script navigates to product pages, handles cookie consent popups, and extracts the price information.

The script does the following:
1. Navigates to the product page of each supermarket.
2. Handles any cookie consent popups if they appear.
3. Extracts and prints the price of potatoes listed on the page.

## InstallationInstall dependent libraries
pip install playwright pandas

pip install openpyxl

### Note: The potato price can only be checked for Aldi.
